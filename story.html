        <h3 class="text">Starting Out</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I still remember that bleak Thursday evening. Thursdays are the worst, especially when you have a test next day. Unfortunately, my physics test was on <strong>Friday</strong>. I wasn't in the mood to study but also didn't want to waste my time watching Youtube videos. That's when I started writing my first poem.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To make things clear, that wasn't my very first time being interested in poetry.</p>
        <br>
        <p>That would be a <strong>stupid</strong> statement.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, that would mark my first day posting online and possibly posting more poems. And that's what happened. I started to write short stories, particularly suspense. I was always interested in <strong>plot twists</strong> and shocking betrayals. At the time, I might have been immature with my way of writing twists; plot twists have to be both surprising but quite reasonable to the reading. You can't turn the high ranked cop into a evil doctor in the span of a few sentences. I still have a lot to learn but hopefully I can write another <strong>suspense</strong> story in the future.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="text">Rhyme Scheme</h3>
        <br>
        <p>One thing I love about writing is how I style the story. I could narrate a story in a regular fashion with thoughtful vocabulary and meaningful dialogues. However, the length of my stories led me to take a different approach. The art of <strong>rhyme scheme</strong>. Having each of the lines rhyme helps the story flow better and makes the overall reading experience engaging. There are some drawbacks that I face from time to time. Sometimes the lines of the story rhyme way better in my head compared to others reading it. Also, trying to rhyme as well as connecting to the story is a challenge and does take time. Often times, I force certain lines to rhyme which is a big mistake as everything begins to feel forced. However, once the story is finished and edited, it's truly a treat.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="text">Posting Stories</h3>
        <p>So when do I write?</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>During my senior year of high school, I would write in class because I would feel so invested in trying to write the next part to a story. However, due to my poor <strong>time managment</strong> in college, things have taken a slight turn.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I write when I'm sad. It's simple as that. When I'm feeling sad, I tend to overthink and need an outlet to relax. Some meditate, some rant and I write. Once I start writing, I don't stop so if I decide to start writing at 1 AM, I'm not going to sleep until 2 AM.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When I draft my stories/poems, I use the notes app. I can easily access my writing pieces between my computer and my phone. Once I'm done, I copy and paste it onto <strong>Canva</strong>, where I set the background color, and format the text. Canva makes it easy for me to download posts into the right Instagram format so it's pretty convenient.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="text">Shoutout</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I would shoutout a lot of my high school friends for always talking about my Instagram account, <strong>origin_story</strong>, but one person in particular that I need to say thanks to is my friend, Yash. I could confidently say that if there's someone who knows that I love rhyming, it has to be him. I've asked him to read a few of my stories beforehand and he's always gave me solid feedback. And to the many friends that have commented, liked and talked about my Instagram posts, it means a lot and I will never forget that.</p>
